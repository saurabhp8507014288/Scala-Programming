Q. Write a Scala program to implement a basic calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide features by using Methods, Class, Object and Fields in Scala.

Explanation:-
        Basically a class named Calculator is being created which contains two methods.
        Method calculation() for arithmetic operation.

        Then we have created one object of class Calculator and callled these two methods with the help of object.

There are four files created on compiling this program

        calculate$.class 
        calculate.class  
        Calculator.class 
        fun.scala
        
Command to compile and run program

        Compilation:-     scalac fun.scala
        Run:-             scala calculate
        
 Outfile file
